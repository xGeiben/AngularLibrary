# AngularLibrary
This is an Angular app created to show some AngularJS functionalities. The project is divided in two main parts, front end and back end, this project was build to test Front end knowledge, thats why the API doesnt have many comments or validations it was just build to fill the basic needs for the app, that being said we can just focus on the /public folder where all the front end code related is located, however feel free to check all the RESTful api if you wish.

## How to run
As i said the functionalities of the app depends on the API so it needed to be on a server, for this we are gonna need node.js(6.11.0 preferably) to server our app, once in the console we just need to go to the folder containing the files and run our server with "node server.js" then we just go to our explorer (Chrome recomended) and go to http://localhost:8080.

## Some points
As you can see theres only one project, this is because i included both test (front-end and angularJS) in the same page, i think it would be the best for matter of developing and it would be easier for you to review one project instead of two.

The app is running with a cloud based MongoDB Database i can provide the log in access if requiered.

At the momment Users and Categories can only be added directly to the Data base.
